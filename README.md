## :bell: About me
My name is Luis Gabriel Maximo, but my friends call me only **"Maximo"**. I'm passionate about software development, especially **backend**, always looking to learn new market technologies. I am methodical in terms of develpment and organization, so I always try to maintain maximum professionalism, but of course, whenever possible, I like to give that relaxed time to the team to ease the mind 😄.In my spare time, I usually play several games with friends and also watch movies and series, I love the Star Wars saga, especially the first trilogy 🎬.
